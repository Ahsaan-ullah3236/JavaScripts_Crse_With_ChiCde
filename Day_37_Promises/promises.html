        // Promises
        // Promises are a way to handle asynchronous operations. They can be thought of as a placeholder for a value that will be available in the future. Promises are used to handle asynchronous operations in JavaScript. They are easy to manage when dealing with multiple asynchronous operations where callbacks can create callback hell leading to unmanageable code.
        // A Promise is in one of these states:
        // pending: initial state, neither fulfilled nor rejected.
        // fulfilled: meaning that the operation completed successfully.
        // rejected: meaning that the operation failed.
        // A promise is a returned object to which you attach callbacks, instead of passing callbacks into a function.
        // A promise is in one of three different states:
        // Pending: This is the initial state of the Promise before an operation begins
        // Fulfilled: This state indicates that the operation was completed successfully
        // Rejected: This state indicates that the operation did not complete successfully and an error value is returned
